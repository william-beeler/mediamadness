		<article id="pic"> Dragon Ball Z (Japanese: ドラゴンボールＺゼット, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) is a Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation. It is the sequel to Dragon Ball and adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama which ran in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1988 to 1995. Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April 26, 1989 to January 31, 1996, before getting dubbed in territories including the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. It was broadcast in at least 81 countries worldwide.[4] It is part of the Dragon Ball media franchise.

Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Goku, who, along with his companions, defend the Earth against villains ranging from aliens (Frieza), androids (Cell) and other creatures (Majin Buu). While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his rival Vegeta.

Due to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters making up its story were initially released by Viz Media under the Dragon Ball Z title. Dragon Ball Z's popularity has spawned numerous releases which have come to represent the majority of content in the Dragon Ball franchise; including 15 movies, 2 TV specials, and 148 video games (many of them being only released in Japan), and a host of soundtracks stemming from this material.</article>

<p class="collapse" id="character">
Funimation
That legit source of Dragon Ball Z is Funimation. They have the exclusive rights to the dubbed version of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z and is the only legit place you can watch the shows. The service isn’t free of course but is where you will find most, if not all, episodes of both series as well as the successors.

The site is fast and easy to use and makes short work of finding Dragon Ball Z shows. The streams are fast and play in HD with good quality audio too. Subscriptions start at $5.99 a month for access to all shows. The upside is that you get access to everything Funimation has to offer. The downside is that even though you’re paying for the service, you are still served ads. This is not the way to run a premium service but is currently your only option for dubbed episodes. </p>
